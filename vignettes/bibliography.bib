Abstract = {In this paper we introduce new power exponentiated family of continuous
   univariate probability distributions with application on two real-life
   datasets. The proposed distribution possesses density function with
   three parameters and constant hazard rate function. We studied the
   nature of distribution with the help of its mathematical and statistical
   properties. Probability density function of order statistics for this
   distribution is also obtained. We perform classical estimation of
   parameters by using the technique of maximum likelihood estimate.
   Application of the model on two real data sets is finally presented and
   compared to the fit attained by some other well-known distributions.},
